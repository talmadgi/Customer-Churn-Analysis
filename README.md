Customer Churn Analysis 
Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using Python and data visualization techniques. The goal is to identify key factors affecting customer retention and provide insights to reduce churn rates.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains 7,043 customer records with 21 features, including:

Demographics: Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents

Subscription details: Tenure, Internet Service, Contract Type

Billing & Payment: Monthly Charges, Total Charges, Payment Method

Churn Label: Indicates whether a customer left the service

Key Insights & Findings
✅ 26.54% of customers have churned
✅ Short-term users (1-2 months) churn the most
✅ Senior Citizens have a higher churn rate
✅ Month-to-month contracts have higher churn compared to yearly contracts
✅ Electronic check users have a higher churn rate
✅ Customers without Online Security & Tech Support are more likely to leave

Project Workflow
✔ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning missing values, transforming variables
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing customer trends using Seaborn & Matplotlib
✔ Churn Pattern Analysis: Identifying high-risk customer segments
✔ Predictive Modeling (Future Scope): Machine learning to predict churn

Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Future Enhancements
🔹 Implement machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
🔹 Develop a dashboard for real-time customer monitoring
