# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction and Retention StrategiesÂ Analysis
# ðŸ“š Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns using a telecom dataset.
The objective is to understand the key factors influencing customer attrition and uncover actionable insights to improve customer retention.

Churn analysis is crucial for businesses to reduce revenue loss, build loyalty, and create proactive retention strategies.

# ðŸ”¥ Project Workflow
Data Inspection

Loaded customer dataset and checked for missing or inconsistent values.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing data.

Converted data types where necessary (e.g., tenure, total charges).

Created categorical and numerical features for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed churn distribution across gender, senior citizenship, contract type, and payment methods.

Visualized insights using pie charts, bar plots, and comparative analysis.

Key Insight Discovery

Identified major drivers of customer churn.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Suggested strategies based on insights to reduce churn.

# ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights and Findings
Overall Churn Rate:

26.54% of customers have churned, while 73.46% stayed.

Gender Influence:

Both male and female customers showed similar churn rates, indicating gender has no significant effect on churn.

Senior Citizens:

Although senior citizens make up a smaller portion of the customer base, their churn rate is significantly higher (6.8%).

Focused retention strategies are needed for senior citizens.

Customer Tenure:

Customers with shorter tenures (1â€“2 months) are more likely to churn, while long-term customers show better retention.

Contract Type:

Month-to-month contract customers have a higher likelihood of churn compared to those on 1-year or 2-year contracts.

Payment Method:

Customers using electronic checks are more prone to churn compared to customers using other payment methods like credit cards or bank transfers.

# ðŸ“‹ Conclusion
ðŸ”¹This analysis highlights that contract type, payment method, customer tenure, and senior citizenship are key drivers of customer churn.
By offering incentives for long-term contracts, improving support for senior citizens, and promoting alternative payment methods, the company can significantly improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.

ðŸ”¹Analyzed a dataset of 7,043 customers to identify churn behavior using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

ðŸ”¹Found that 26.5% of customers churned, with key factors including month-to-month contracts, electronic check payments, and short tenures.

ðŸ”¹Delivered 5+ actionable insights to support data-driven customer retention strategies, focusing on senior citizens and contract optimization.
